# Speech-Enhancement-using-Spectral-Subtraction-type-Algorithm
This project was made as a part of the course 'Digital Signal Processing'. Here, a noisy signal is enhanced by removing the distortion from it. I have made use of Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) technique in it.

Input : sample.wav                  
Output : out.wav
